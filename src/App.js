                  <li><strong>What it is:</strong> an AI editor that safely updates long troubleshooting guides by <strong>editing only the relevant sections</strong>â€”not rewriting the whole doc.</li>

                  <li><strong>How it works:</strong> it <em>ingests feedback</em> (PR comments, incident notes) and a <strong>Feedback Evaluator</strong> <em>denoises</em> itâ€”keeping only <strong>relevant, actionable items</strong> and linking each to its target section. It then <em>looks up facts</em> via retrieval, plans a <strong>section-scoped, minimal-diff</strong> change (add/alter/optional rename) while <strong>deduplicating overlaps</strong> unless they add unique value, and applies the change through <strong>guardrailed tools</strong> ("view-before-edit").</li>

                  <li><strong>LLM-as-Judge (quality gate):</strong> independently scores Non-Hallucinated, Content Preservation, and Feedback Incorporation Accuracy. We A/B-tested judge prompts and spot-checked against human ratings to reduce false passes; only passing edits are promoted, failures trigger targeted retries with re-planning and re-editing.</li>

                  <li><strong>Impact (sanitized):</strong> <strong>&gt;90% task success (~18pp lift)</strong>, with <strong>fewer hallucinations</strong>, strong <strong>content preservation (CP)</strong>, and <strong>accurate feedback incorporation (FI)</strong> â€” reducing <em>Time-to-Mitigate (TTM)</em>.</li>

                  <li><strong>Guardrails:</strong> <em>add/alter-only</em> edits, <strong>view-before-edit</strong>, <strong>deterministic rebuild</strong> for clean diffs, and <strong>preservation of every original technical string</strong> (URLs, commands, queries).</li>

                  <li><strong>Reliability engineering:</strong> <em>exponential backoff</em>, <strong>idempotent</strong> edit ops/keys (re-runs can't duplicate changes), and a <em>progress summarizer</em> for long-horizon accuracy.</li>

                  <li><strong>Information flow (tagging/trace):</strong> every fact gets a <em>Source tag</em> (where it entered: PR comment, incident note, or retrieved snippet) and a <em>Usage trace</em> that records where it was applied (plan step ID, section edit, judge check). These records live in the <strong>plan trace and change log</strong>â€”the final document stays cleanâ€”so the input â†’ plan â†’ edit â†’ validation path is auditable.</li>

                  <li><strong>Evaluation & metrics:</strong> <em>Task Success</em> = PASS if <strong>CP â‰¥ 8/10</strong>, <strong>FI â‰¥ 8/10</strong>, and <strong>NH</strong> is low-risk. Evaluated on <strong>&gt;100 docs</strong> with the strongest relative gains on smaller models; computed by the <em>LLM-as-Judge</em>.</li>

                  <li><strong>Research:</strong> authored and submitted an <em>internal Microsoft Research paper</em> on the architecture, methodology, and evaluation (exact figures withheld pending approval).</li>

                  <li><strong>Generalizes to:</strong> <em>any anchored/structured technical document</em> with stable section/step/ID anchors â€” not just TSGs. Examples: SOPs, runbooks, KB articles, design docs, change playbooks; formats like <strong>Markdown (.md)</strong>, HTML, YAML, and JSON. In practice, this covers <em>most technical documentation</em>.</li>

                  <p className="text-xs opacity-70">"Anchored/structured" = documents with stable anchors the editor can target (e.g., headings, step numbers, or explicit IDs).</p>

                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> designed to <strong>reduce alert fatigue</strong>, <strong>improve anomaly-detection precision</strong>, and <strong>reduce Time-to-Detection (TTD)</strong> in real ops.</li>

                {/* Expanded details */}
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> built in <strong>C#</strong>, with evaluation against <em>human judgment</em> on historical incidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Method:</strong> features extracted between <em>impact start</em> and <em>detection</em>; candidates compared across agents; supports <em>human-in-the-loop</em> approval.</li>
                <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> <em>structured JSON outputs</em>, logging, seed control; plan to compare agent picks to <em>human-selected thresholds</em> at scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Next steps:</strong> <strong>RLHF</strong> to learn a <em>single policy</em> that predicts thresholds from incident context, with <strong>confidence calibration</strong> and guardrailsâ€”aiming to <strong>gradually shrink the ensemble</strong> as accuracy improves; plus <strong>continuous testing</strong> and <strong>fully automated integration</strong> (offline/online eval harness, canary rollout).</li>
                <li><strong>Why RLHF:</strong> train the system on <em>human preferences and outcomes</em> so it learns which thresholds operators actually acceptâ€”and avoids noisy suggestions.</li>
